# vue3-portfolio

Source code for my [portfolio website](https://www.FlynnData.org) hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and built with Vue 3 in Vite.

## My JS/TS Framework experiences thus far

I tested many other frameworks and SSR configurations, Next, Nuxt, React, Angular, Flask and Django primarily. Vue felt the most natural and polished: thorough and to the point documentation and clean state tracking. Plus seameless 'typescript' support, so I think I'm going to settle on vue3.

I'm planning on incorperating many community driven ideas such as [A GUI similar to TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.07104&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)

## This is an ongoing process. I'm learning as I go.
